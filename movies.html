			<td><p> The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe (2005)
Main article: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe
The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, based on the 1950 novel of the same title, is the first film in the series. Directed by Andrew Adamson, it was shot mainly in New Zealand, though locations were used in Poland, the Czech Republic and the United Kingdom.
The story follows the four British Pevensie siblings, who are evacuated during the Blitz to the countryside, where they find a wardrobe that leads to the fantasy world of Narnia. There, they must ally with the lion Aslan against the forces of the White Witch, who has placed Narnia in an eternal winter.
The film was released theatrically on 9 December 2005 and on DVD on 4 April 2006 and grossed over $745 million worldwide.</p></td>

<td><p>The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian (2008)
Main article: The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian
Prince Caspian, based on the 1951 novel of the same title, is the second film in the series and the last distributed by Walt Disney Pictures.
The story follows the same Pevensie children who were transported to Narnia in the previous film as they return to Narnia, where 1,300 years have passed and the land has been invaded by the Telmarines. The four Pevensie children aid Prince Caspian in his struggle for the throne against his corrupt uncle, King Miraz.</p></td>

<td><p>The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader (2010)
Main article: The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, based on the 1952 novel of the same title, is the first film in the series not to be co-produced by Disney, who dropped out over a budget dispute with Walden Media. In January 2009, it was announced that Fox 2000 Pictures would replace Disney for future installments, although thanks to the acquisition of 21st Century Fox, Disney now owns the rights to all films. Directed by Michael Apted, the movie was filmed almost entirely in Australia.
The story follows the two younger Pevensie children as they return to Narnia with their cousin, Eustace Scrubb. They join Caspian, now king of Narnia, in his quest to rescue seven lost lords and save Narnia from a corrupting evil that resides on a dark island.[6]
The film was released on 10 December 2010 (in RealD 3D in select theatres) and grossed over $415 million worldwide.</p></td>
